Conlusion

That conical hat of the figure drops to the ground as his body dissipates
into the air. A pool of blood begins to congeal where the menacing figure 
once stood. You cannot help but wonder if you actually defeated the beast.

You look down at your hands and notice that your arm is freckled with a 
black hue. As if your opponent, left a bit of himself with you. 

You descend from the mountain. A treacherous jorney, but one you are well
prepared to handle. At the base of the mountain your hands begin to tingle.
Your head feels light, as you bring your hand up to clasp your forehead a 
column of earth is pulled from the land. You push your hand out in wonder,
the column is obliterated.
