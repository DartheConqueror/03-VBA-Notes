Introduction

The winter rages on. In the land of snow and ice, the cold freezes the hearts of most men,
yet Dar's nipples barely harden.

Our hero, Dar the Conqueror, spots a figure dressed in familiar 
garments and a conical farmer’s hat. Before his very eyes a creature of ice and wind 
erupts from the figure’s staff, yet this beast stays still.  

Dar breathes heavily; the condensation billowing from his mouth. His eyes stare 
forward, intently. Slowly, he draws his sword, the metal gleams. A silence lay between Dar and his foe.

Now, live the adventure that you have been pining for since the release of Dar the Conqueror: Chapter I.

Enjoy this music, it's dope, right? You will not be able to do anything until the song
finishes. That is about a minute and half. So, relax, think about all that Dar the Conqueror
has accomplished. And remember, what is best in life:

To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women!
